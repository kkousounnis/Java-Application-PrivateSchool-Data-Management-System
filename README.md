# Java-Console-Application-PrivateSchool-Data-Management-System

The development of this project includes the implementation of a private school structure.

The application needs to hold in a database multiple courses along with the enrolled students, 
the trainers that teach the subjects and the assignments that the students need to submit during the course duration.

This repository refers to the first part  of the project Part A and it asks 
from the command prompt to input data to all the entities
and it gives the option to add more than one entry at a time.
If the user decides not to type any data, the program gives us synthetic data.
Also, the program is able to output the following:

1)A list of all the students. 

2)A list of all the trainers. 

3)A list of all the assignments.

4)A list of all the courses. 

5)All the students per course.

6)All the trainers per course.

7)All the assignments per course.

8)All the assignments per student.

9)A list of students that belong to more than one courses.

10)Lastly, the program asks from the user a date and it should output a list of
students who need to submit one or more assignments on the same calendar week
as the given date.
